## Usage

### 1. Clone Repo

Github released [Github Templates](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) which allows users to generate a new repo from a template repo that will have the exact same files and structure. You can generate your own repo from this template by using [this link](https://github.com/kyrelldixon/next-tailwind-typescript-starter/generate).

From there, you can clone your own repo and modify it however you like.

If you would rather clone this repo, go to the command line and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyrelldixon/next-tailwind-typescript-starter <your-project-name>
cd <your-project-name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install # npm i
```

### 3. Run Development Environment

```bash
yarn start:dev # npm run dev
```

### Test Production Environment

I also included a `stage` script that will build and start a production server. You can run it with:

```bash
yarn stage # npm run stage
```

Alternatively you can run:

```bash
yarn build # npm run build
yarn start # npm start
```
